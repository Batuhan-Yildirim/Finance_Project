<h1 align="center" id="title">Finance Machine Learning Project</h1>

In this Python project I developed a machine learning application for time series forecasting using my own custom dataset. To accomplish this I created a Python file to gather and organize the necessary data. Leveraging the neuralforecast library I trained a neural network model on the dataset to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the time series data. 
The project involved loading and preprocessing the dataset configuring the neural network model architecture and training the model using the neuralforecast library. I ensured the proper formatting of the data and handled any missing values or categorical variables. 

With the trained model I could generate accurate predictions for future time points based on historical data. The neuralforecast library provided the necessary functionalities for forecasting enabling me to leverage the power of neural networks in capturing intricate patterns. 

Throughout the project I paid careful attention to evaluating the performance of the machine learning application. Using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or mean absolute error (MAE), I assessed the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.

Overall this project demonstrated the effective use of a custom dataset Python programming and the neuralforecast library to develop a powerful machine learning application for time series forecasting. By leveraging neural networks I could unlock valuable insights and make accurate predictions in my specific problem domain.
